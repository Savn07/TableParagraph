            </h1>
            <p> It’s incredible to realize that before 2004, the name Tesla was synonymous with a quirky genius inventor
                from the 1900s. However, after the launch of Elon Musk’s third company SpaceX in 2002, the world was
                watching closely as he co-founded his fourth company that would launch a new brand of electric car.
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 50px;
            text-align: justify;
            letter-spacing: 3px;">
                The original vision of Tesla Motors was to build a sports car “as a catalyst to accelerate the day of
                electric vehicles.” A lofty goal, and interestingly, no mention of earning money.It took another three
                years until 2006 when Tesla’s all-electric Roadster won Time’s Best Inventions Award. In 2008, the Tesla
                Roadster went into full production. It was the first production electric vehicle to travel 200 miles per
                charge.
